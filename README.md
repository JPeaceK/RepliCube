# What is this?
RepliCube is a robot that solves and replicates Rubik Cubes. This robot is equipped with advanced computer vision capabilities that enable it to solve a Rubik's Cube and replicate the pattern of another cube with high accuracy. The robot utilizes a camera to scan and capture the configuration of a Rubik's Cube, which is then stored in its memory for further processing. 

# Our main goal?
  
We are a group of 4 students currently studying Computer Engineering at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona.  This project is part of a subject called Robòtica, Llenguatge i Programació (RLP), where we are tasked with creating a robot using Agile methods. And our main goal is to bring our 3-month project to life. 

That being said, we hope you enjoy our little project. 

# Requirements
For running code:
 - [Python 3.11.x](https://www.python.org/)

For development:
 - [We used PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/pycharm/)

# Documentation
All the documentation that might be useful, like servo motors guides, Hardware Structure, or Software Architecture are provided in this repository. The directories that contain this files are named:

 - [Hardware](https://github.com/JPeaceK/RepliCube/tree/main/Hardware)
 - [Software]()
 - [Manual de Fabricantes](https://github.com/JPeaceK/RepliCube/tree/main/Manuales%20de%20Fabricantes)

It is also provided a report that contains all development procedures named "Replicube Report".

# How to use

# Images
You can find a folder named "Images" where all the test images we have used to evaluate our core Computer Vision functionalities are featured. These images have been captured by a Raspberry Pi Camera Module directly connected to the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.

# 3D
You will also find a folder named "3D" where you can locate all our .stl files that were used in the construction of the robot. This folder includes some pieces that were not ultimately used due to design changes, but we have included them here as they are still part of our project.
